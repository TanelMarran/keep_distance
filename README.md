## Process

Completing this project took me about 7 days of work, on and off. 

The largest hurdles were at the start of the project, since I had to learn how to use Phaser 3, Typescript as well as how to get the two working together in my project. Once I got past that initial barrier, things started to pick up pace and the process of creating the app became more enjoyable. 

Overall I'm really happy with how it turned out. I learnt how to use Phaser 3, started loving Typescript, used some other packages such as intro.js and chart.js which were both fun to explore. I walked through a lot of beginner mistakes when creating a node.js app, everything from missing dependencies in my package.json file because they were globally installed on my device to issues deploying the app to the web using Heroku. Lastly it was fun to design the game and work some charm into its presentation. The first time I saw how different the curves were when social distancing was on and off was a great moment!

If there is one thing that I am not satisfied with and which I'd love to work on more, it would be my CSS. Currently my website's styling is pretty weak and it didn't help that it was the last thing I worked on during the long week of development.
